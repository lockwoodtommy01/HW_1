# HW_1
This is the first week's homework where we were instructed to modify existing code
I added correct semantic code to the HTML code and fixed the CSS file while also cleaning up the CSS in the process
I added in the alt elements to the images to meet the accessibility standards for HTML
<img src="/assets/images/Capture.PNG"/>
